3 Rings Reserve Shiraz 2004,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,96.0,"Vintage Comments : Classic Barossa vintage conditions. An average wet Spring followed by extreme heat in early February. Occasional rainfall events kept the vines in good balance up to harvest in late March 2004. Very good quality coupled with good average yields. More than 30 months in wood followed by six months tank maturation of the blend prior to bottling, July 2007. "
Abreu Vineyards Cappella 2007,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Cappella is a proprietary blend of two clones of Cabernet Sauvignon with Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. The gravelly soil at Cappella produces fruit that is very elegant in structure. The resulting wine exhibits beautiful purity of fruit with fine grained and lengthy tannins. "
Abreu Vineyards Cappella 2010,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98.0,"Cappella is one of the oldest vineyard sites in St. Helena. Six acres that sit alongside a Catholic cemetery on the west side of town, it was first planted in 1869. In the 1980s the church asked David to tear out the old vines, then he watched as the land lay fallow for close to two decades. When he finally got the chance to replant, he jumped. He'd tasted fruit from Cappella in the 70s. He knew what kind of wine it could make. But that first replant was ill-fated thanks to diseased rootstock, and once again he was ripping out vines. “It took us six years before we had a crop. We could have ignored it, pulled the vines out one by one as they collapsed. But then we'd have all these different ripening patterns, which would impact consistency. It was an easy decision.”"
Abreu Vineyards Howell Mountain 2008,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"When David purchased this Howell Mountain property in 2000 it came with an unexpected perk: first growth redwood stakes dating back over a century. Relics of an earlier era of agriculture. “When the college owned this site they'd burn all the underbrush, including the stakes, to keep it clean. When I came in we found them and set them all aside,” he says. At about 2000 feet elevation, Las Posadas sits above the fog line, surrounded by a protected forest of fir and pine. Red Aiken soils are layered over white tufa, and the rocks that littered the site before it was planted now form walls defining the property. The redwood stakes—collected, stacked, preserved—await their next life."
Abreu Vineyards Howell Mountain 2009,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98.0,"As a set of wines, it is hard to surpass the four cuvees from the estate vineyards of David Abreu. As I have written many times in the past, all of these wines are truly world-class efforts that stand alongside proprietary red wines made from Bordeaux varietals from any appellation in the world. "

Abreu Vineyards Thorevilos 2015,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"Thorevilos was one of David's favorite haunts as a child. There were no vines then. Just pine trees, redwoods, an old olive grove. And a rusted hog wire hanging from a tree—“Hook Man” in Abreu family lore. These days it's the dirt that engrosses him. White tufa that turns to fine powder when you grind it beneath your foot. Tannish soil peppered with orange-brown pebbles. Streaks of dry, red earth.

Accendo Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon 2016,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Reflecting the outstanding vintage, the captivating nose of this wine shows dark and brooding aromas of cassis,plum and blackberry, touched by exotic notes of lavender, anise, pencil lead and leather. On the palate, rich flavorsof ripe black fruits are wrapped around a firm structure of fine-grained tannins, minerality and beautiful freshnessthat carry on into the long, satisfying finish.

Agharta Black Label Red 2004,"North Coast, California",Red Wine,98.0,"Evolved aromas of roasted earth, dried leather and meat jus immediately emerge from the surface of this opaque liquid. Eventually fruit aromas respond to your coaxing and tiny currants, the ripest blackberries and the densest of blue fruits fill out the darker more evolved aromas of leather and tar. The wine is thick and immediately mouth coating with a very richly textured and immensely concentrated sensation of fruit and spice. The secondary aromas of delicate white flowers, black summer truffles and dark roasted coffee highlight the fruit as the wine unfolds in your mouth.

She is fashioned out of clay and as you know, handed a vessel that she is instructed not to open.  Of course, curiosity forces her to take a look.  In that moment, all the challenges of the world are released- much like the effect of the apple in Eden.  What is all too often overlooked is that Pandora shuts the vessel in time to retain one attribute: Hope.  Naturally as the first woman, she is the source of all hope for mankind.  "

Albert Boxler Riesling Grand Cru Brand Kirchberg 2016,"Alsace, France",White Wine,98.0,"ne whiff of this might make you want to plunge right into the glass. Once the wine hits your tongue... Nope, zingy lemon, delicate white flowers, rich mineral backbone, beautiful mouthwatering finish, incredible length...

Alto Moncayo Aquilon 2004,Spain,Red Wine,96.0,"""The 1,000 case luxury cuvee, the 2004 Aquilon, was fashioned from the winery's oldest vines and best material. Revealing nearly off the chart ripeness, richness, and intensity, it will undoubtedly be controversial, separating traditionalists from more progressive tasters, but I loved it. It will be interesting to see how this tour de force in winemaking ages. It is the vino equivalent of a Hummer four-wheel drive vehicle."""

A gorgeously complex perfume of kirsch liqueur, black raspberries, cassis, minerals, flowers, and sweet oak is followed by a full-bodied, massively-endowed, pure, textured, well-balanced wine. Given the limited production and high quality of this fabulous effort, its high price can not be considered unfair. It should drink well for a decade. Australian winemaker Chris Ringland oversees the winemaking at this estate, a superb new discovery by broker Jorge Ordonez. This full-throttle, robust, exuberant, super-concentrated 100% Grenache offering may be the finest wine to ever emerge from this backwater Spanish appellation."" - Wine Advocate"

Amapola Creek Estate Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,"Sonoma Valley, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The nose on this wine opens with a luscious dollop of blackberry and red, juicy plum. Swirl the glass once or twice, and you will start to uncover darker fruit notes of blackcurrant and a bare hint of pomegranate, accented with subtle notes of oak and toasted vanilla. Take a sip, and the first thing you will notice is a firm acidity that opens quickly onto dark black fruit with just a touch of anise. As your first impression fades, you will find deeply  structured tannins that fill the palate, underscoring a finish redolent with chocolate, blueberry preserves, and aged cedar. This wine evolves marvelously over the course of a glass, growing bigger and bolder as it takes in the air. The tannins unfold and show the excellent maturity of the grapes as they were brought in from the vineyard, and the fruit characters gain in intensity, building to an intricate finish that lasts for many minutes. "
Amici Beckstoffer Missouri Hopper Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2016,"Oakville, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"A gorgeous, fragrant nose of black cherry, plum and dark chocolate is washed with hints of vanilla.

Amici Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2016,"Oakville, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"The power of this heritage vineyard lies in its distinct nose with classic To Kalon aromas of clay loam, wet earth and mint.

Prevailing westerly winds pass over a large, cold pond and blow uphill, parallel to the rows of vines.

This wine offers a flavor profile of complex red fruits, floral, coffee, minerality, and elegant tannins."
Anakota Helena Dakota Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2017,"Knights Valley, Sonoma County, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The 2017 growing season was defined by plentiful rain in the winter followed by mild conditions in spring and summer. To preserve the natural acidity in the grapes, picking began early on September 12th in the Dakota vineyard. The wines were resting in barrel prior to the Sonoma County Tubbs fire in October, therefore remained unaffected by any smoke taint. The 2017 Helena Dakota expresses perfumed aromatics of violet blossom and blackberry liquor with subtle notes of menthol and dried black currants. The luxurious, silky palate is accompanied by hints of toasted baking spices and tobacco leaf. Each element is beautifully integrated and complimented with velvety tannins and vibrant acidity, for which drive its satisfyingly long finish."

Antinori Pian delle Vigne Brunello di Montalcino 1997,"Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",Red Wine,97.0,"The latter part of winter and the beginning of Spring were very mild for the time of year and also very dry. This produced early budding - some 10 days earlier than average. In April the temperature suddenly dropped, causing and arrest in growth of the buds. The Summer was very hot and sunny and this weather continued for the whole of September and for the duration of the harvest, which meant that at the time of picking, the grapes were exceptionally healthy and with a high sugar concentration. Overall the 1997 harvest was somewhat less than expected in terms of quantity - but in terms of quality, this is an exceptional vintage, probably even better than the much acclaimed 1990 vintage and one of the greatest of the last fifty years. Full-structured and velvety, with rich perfumes and hints of flowers, vanilla and chocolate."

Notions of menthol, scorched rocks, mocha, black cherries, cassis, chocolate, and espresso are found in this terrific offering. It will be developed and forward upon release, but will last for 12-15 years.    Winemaker and part owner, John Kongsgaard, produces these wines in partnership with auctioneer, Fritz Hatton. They are all fashioned from fruit grown in the ""H Block"" of the Hudson Vineyard, the highest point on that large ranch. The vineyard is planted in white volcanic ash-dominated soils. The Cabernet Franc/Merlot blend is the Arietta and the Syrah/Merlot blend is named Variation One. These striking offerings have a European sensitivity for elegance, structure, and delineation, but are clearly products of California, as evidenced by their prodigious ripeness as well as intensity. They are expensive, but impressive efforts that should be long-lived."" - Wine Advocate"

Critic Robert Parker gave the 2000 Arietta H Block the highest score of any Napa Red Wine in the 2000 vintage. The blend is 50% Cabernet Franc and 50% Merlot. This wine has harmonized beautifully in the bottle and is hard to resist, though should evolve for another five or ten years. "

Barnett Vineyards Rattlesnake Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5L Magnum) 2013,"Spring Mountain District, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98.0,"The 2013 Rattlesnake is nearly black in color. The complex nose is very serious in its youth, but after a bit of air the layers of complexity emerge. Blackcurrant puree and fresh blackberries are matched with dark chocolate, crushed violets and coffee grounds. Beautiful underlying aromas of spring rain and volcanic earth begin to emerge. Silky at the beginning the tannins begin to emerge and show the wines youth. Blueberry pie and more dark chocolate are prominent on the palate. The sizeable tannins are in a chalky complex form that are matched by the acidity but scream for cellaring. "

Aromas of raspberries and vanilla bean are complemented by dark chocolate and licorice. Layers of allspice, clove and cassis are also apparent. Upon tasting the wine is very viscous with darker fruit flavors to match the vanilla and pure black peppercorn emerges. The tannins are quite firm with great acidity to back it up.

Beringer Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2001,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"I love the individual expression of terroir in single-vineyard wines, but the opulence, power and grace of Beringer's Private Reserve can only be achieved by blending.

Here the fruits lean toward blackberry and raspberry, where both tannin and acid are abundant.. Clone 174 expresses the ripest character of the French clones, combining boysenberry, and pomegranate. At Ranch at the end of the Road, the early ripening Tablas creek clone provides blueberry fruit and smoky meatiness."
Betz Family Winery Pere de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon 2015,"Columbia Valley, Washington",Red Wine,96.0,"2015 Père de Famille Cabernet Sauvignon shows its lineage clearly, while also expressing the conditions of the vintage. It’s a deep magenta through to the core. A knockout aroma of black currant and black cherry comes next, enhanced by bay leaf and thyme. Black olive notes share the stage with baking spices. Aromas of white flowers and red currants tease their way out with time in the glass. The palate impression is one of early integration between the oak and grape tannins. The inclusion of Merlot and Petit Verdot help create a seamless texture, and extend the length of flavor on the palate. Expect 2015 Père de Famille to be delicious young, but to offer up to two decades of cellar life."

Winemaker Russell Bevan uses several press barrels from Tin Box, Tench and Wildfoote, which have chewy, vibrant textures.

Bevan Cellars Proprietary Red EE Tench Vineyard 2016,"Oakville, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98.0,"The 2016 EE Red Blend combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot.

Blankiet Paradise Hills Merlot 2003,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"""The 2003 Merlot is better out of bottle than it was from cask. An explosively rich wine that ranks among the finest Merlots I have tasted from California in the last decade, it boasts an incredibly perfumed nose of espresso roast, mocha-infused chocolate, blackberry, cassis, cherry liqueur, and smoke. With an enormous texture, fabulous concentration, a packed-and-stacked mid-palate, and an explosive intense, ripe, long finish, this stunning wine is extraordinarily complex and savory. Anticipated maturity: now-2020. As I have written before, the only way readers are going to get any of this wine is to be on the mailing list or check out one of the few restaurants that receives an allocation. This is an amazing operation on the hillsides overlooking the huge Dominus/Napanook estate. A complex set of caves and a remarkable, nearly surreal chateau grace the property. Winemaker Helen Turley, working with her viticulturalist husband, John Wetlaufer, is fashioning some spectacular wines from these hillsides of volcanic ash and basalt. These are big, structured, potentially long-lived wines that will need some cellar time for those lucky enough to latch onto a few bottles. Everything to date has been aged in 100% new Taransaud barrels for 18-19 months and then bottled unfiltered."" - Wine Advocate"""

Similar in color, the nose offers a beautiful perfume of pain grille, vanilla, forest floor, black currant, and blackberry liqueur.

Booker Vineyard My Favorite Neighbor 2013,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,99.0,"A candidate for the wine of the vintage, the inky colored 2013 My Favorite Neighbor Proprietary Blend is a heavenly blend of 37% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Petit Verdot and 29% Syrah that spent 18 months in French oak. Thrillingly pure, layered, unctuous and massively concentrated, it exhibits classic notes of blueberries, violets, black raspberries, spice and graphite. These give way to a full-bodied, seamless and layered 2013 that has building tannin, incredible purity of fruit and a blockbuster finish. Give it a year or two and enjoy bottles through 2025."
Booker Vineyard My Favorite Neighbor 2014,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,99.0,"Always one of Booker Vineyard's most popular wines, MFN was aged in French oak for 24 months and is as balanced as it has ever been before. In barrel the Cabernet and Syrah wanted to rear their head and show their ripeness, but the massive Petit Verdot would not allow them. This is reminiscent of one of (my favorite neighbor) Stephan Asseo's legendary Estate Cuvee wines. You will be rewarded for aging this wine 2 years."
Booker Vineyard Remnant 24 2012,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0, 
Booker Vineyard Ripper Grenache 2011,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Most consider our Ripper to be the most elegant wine we produce with its delicate red fruits and hints of cherry cola. We partially age the wine in neutral French 500L oak barrels, and the other part of the wine in concrete tanks. The Ripper is only made in select years when our Grenache crop shows top-quality."
Booker Vineyard Ripper Grenache 2012,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Most consider our Ripper to be the most elegant wine we produce with its delicate red fruits and hints of cherry cola.

Booker Vineyard Ripper Grenache 2014,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,98.0,"Most consider the Ripper to be the most elegant wine Booker Vineyard produces with its delicate red fruits and hints of cherry cola. They partially age the wine in neutral French 500L oak barrels, and the other parts of the wine in concrete tanks. The Ripper is only made in select years when the Grenache crop shows top-quality."
Booker Vineyard Ripper Grenache 2015,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,97.0,"Another Southern Rhone wine, this 100% Grenache is a bowl full of strawberries and raspberries. No new wood, no stems, just pure, unadulterated Grenache that has historically been Booker Vineyard's flagship and one of the few true Grenaches at this level on the market. In 2014 they pushed the envelope by heating at high temps during fermentation and extracting lots of color and tannins. In 2015 they wanted to go back to my traditional style of making a wine that is approachable immediately as opposed to having you wait and cellar."
Booker Vineyard Ripper Grenache 22 2015,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The extended version of Ripper is softer and denser than its counterpart, and will need 6 months to start showing off beautiful color and extraction, with deeper red flavors than in the past. The early bottling shows more ripe strawberries and raspberries, whereas the extra time in barrel mellows those out and converts to stewed red fruits. The density is beautiful and the finish is more than a minute long."
Booker Vineyard Tempranillo 2013,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"As most of you know, the Tempranillo is only made in stellar vintages. A large and masculine wine, the Tempranillo shows classic black notes of espresso and dark chocolate with hints of blackberry and firm tannins on the finish. The real beauty of this wine though is that as masculine as it is, it is not overly massive or syrupy. Quite the contrary! It accomplishes the goal of seeming like a massive wine while still coming across the palate as elegant as the top Spanish Tempranillos do! "
Booker Vineyard Tempranillo 2014,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,99.0,"As massive and dark as this wine has ever been, this vintage truly screams all things dark with a double espresso shot with firm tannins yet surprising hints of red fruit on the finish. This beast will need at least a year to relax and become consumer friendly."
Booker Vineyard The Ripper Grenache (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2011,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Most consider our Ripper to be the most elegant wine we produce with its delicate red fruits and hints of cherry cola. We partially age the wine in neutral French 500L oak barrels, and the other part of the wine in concrete tanks. The Ripper is only made in select years when our Grenache crop shows top-quality."
Booker Vineyard Vertigo 2013,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,97.0,"Holy cow! This wine is a beast. Great fruit, density, length, andstructure. As always, this blend of Grenache, Syrah, and Mourvèdreis made using whole clusters in fermentation. This adds a gorgeousspice and tannin that sets this wine completely apart from allothers. Big and dense like Fracture, but paired with a beautifularray of spices and floral aromatics. Currently it is drinking verytight, like most whole cluster wines, and likely will be bestconsumed in six months to a year's time."
Booker Vineyard Vertigo 24 2012,"Paso Robles, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,97.0,"With roughly 40% whole cluster, the extended version shows impeccable structure with hints of spice that should make it a perfect pair for upcoming holiday dinners. This wine was aged in once-used 300L hogshead barrels and has a lot of structure and tannin. This is surely a wine that will benefit from an extra six months of aging. "
Bouchard Pere & Fils Bonnes Mares Grand Cru 2006,"Burgundy, France",Red Wine,96.0,"Aromas of red and blue pinot fruit with violet hints that precede ripe, pure and very serious broad-shouldered flavors that possess a beguiling texture and impressive mid-palate concentration that still does not completely buffer the firm, long and chewy finish. This is a big wine that will require plenty of cellar patience."

Brand Cabernet Sauvignon 2015,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"This stunning Cabernet Sauvignon puts forth a magnificent nose of licorice, graphite, with concentrated black fruits and hints of truffle and toasted oak. On the palate, its powerful yet elegant tannins engulf the senses with layers of dark cherry, blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate, culminating with a finish you’ll enjoy long after the final sip. "
Branson Coach House Coach House Block Cabernet Sauvignon 2004,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,98.0,"""A compelling Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2004 Coach House Block was aged in 100% new French Taransaud barrels. Its blue/black/purple color is followed by beautiful aromas of graphite, acacia flowers, blackberries, and creme de cassis. Full-bodied, dense, and rich, this amazing Cabernet admirably demonstrates what heights this varietal can achieve in the Barossa. Cellar it for 3-4 years and enjoy it over the following 2-3 decades."""
Branson Coach House Coach House Block Shiraz 2003,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,96.0,"This single-vineyard bottling from the makers of Two Hands is a huge wine that doesn't feel as big as it is, glowing at the center with blueberry, purple plum and currant fruit, shaded on the edges with sweet spices, sage and a touch of creamy oak, all of it expanding on the finish against ultrafine tannins. The aftertaste lingers for days. Best from 2007 through 2020. 750 cases made."
Brovia Barolo Villero 2005,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,96.0,"A classic powerful and full-bodied wine from a historical vineyard of Castiglione Falletto. The color is intense ruby red with a light presence of orange reflections. The smell is elegant, intense, pleasant, balanced and with a hint of withered roses, plums, minerals, tobacco, liquorice, smoke and leather. The taste is full bodied, balanced and velvety, with a huge structure and a very long finish.  "
Brovia Ca'Mia Barolo (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2006,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,96.0,"A very complete and long aging wine from a great vineyard of Serralunga d'Alba. The color is intense ruby red. The smell is intense, pleasant, balanced and spicy with a bouquet of plums, cedar, tobacco, liquorice, soy and floral notes. The taste is full bodied, concentrated and rich, with a firm tannic structure that classic Barolo needs for a long aging."
Brovia Ca'Mia Barolo 2008,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,96.0,"We often call this cru ""Il Ruffiano"" for its rustic, raffish nature.  This is a boisterous, friendly Barolo from the heart of Serralunga d'Alba with all that zone's lush fruit and generous body.  Here the wine thrusts us into the dense ambience of the forest: the dark berry-like fruit, the moss and underbrush, the truffles and mushrooms of the Langhe.  It's all there with bravado and confidence.  Warm, rich, dense … one of our best friends at the table."
Brovia Garblet Sue Barolo 2008,"Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,96.0,"The Garblet Sue distinguishes itself by its enormous energy, a positive and heady wine with a gorgeous interplay of black fruits and minerals. The lively presence on the palate reminds one of the remarkable ability of Nebbiolo to retain its vibrant acidity while building its sugar reserves. A favorite of ours."
Brovia Garblet Sue Barolo 2013,"Barolo, Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,98.0,"The tannic and mineral structure of the 2013 elevates the “Garblet Sue” to another level. Initially, the wine is quite generous and pleasant, with somewhat high-toned, red fruits underscored by dark feral and dried-herb notes, but the wine finishes with an edgy acidity and ferocious tannins that are reminiscent of the “Villero”. The complexity and structure of the 2013 “Garblet Sue” is a testament to the seriousness and potential longevity of this classically structured vintage. If you must pull corks on your ‘13s early, this is your best bet, but we recommend you give all of these wines as much time as you can muster."
Brovia Rocche (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2007,"Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,96.0,"An extremely fine and elegant wine from one of the great vineyards of Castiglione Falletto. The color is garnet red with light orange colored reflections. The nose is balanced and intense with violets, strawberries, prunes, cherries, mint, woody essence, licorice and some balsamic notes. The taste begins slowly, but it grows incrementally until coating the palate.  "

Brovia Rocche 2008,"Piedmont, Italy",Red Wine,96.0,"This splendid site in Castiglione Falletto, the fabled ""Rocche,"" gives us a window onto the elegant, feminine side of Barolo. Always the most aromatic and sensual of the crus from Brovia, the Rocche dei Brovia carries its weight with a ballerina-like delicacy on top of tannins that are sweet and silky.

Bryant Family Cabernet Sauvignon 1994,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"The enormously promising, potentially perfect 1994 Cabernet Sauvignon is one of those rare wines that possesses awesome aromatic, flavor, and texture dimensions. Totally dry, it comes across as sweet because of its highly extracted, ripe fruit. Opaque purple/black-colored, with a knock-out nose of black fruit (cassis and black-raspberries), this wine hits the palate with phenomenal concentration that brilliantly manages to be neither heavy nor overbearing.

Roughly 33% of the final blend came from Spring Mountain whose vineyard sites have soils composed primarily of volcanic loam, imparting fine tannins and delicate floral notes to the wine. To the east on Howell Mountain, we have two estate vineyards making up roughly 25% that contribute dark fruit characters, herbs and weight adding complexity and depth. "

It opens up immediately with floral aromatics mixed with dark currants, exotic spices and blue/black fruits. Once again, this To Kalon is noticeably darker and the most virile wine of the Carter Cellar's 2013 offering. Revealing superb balance and concentration it is a successful expression of richness and power - the hallmark of this Beckstoffer To Kalon wine. The pliant mid-palate is composed of firm but sweet tannins which are fully integrated into the plush dark fruit and toasted oak notes. While drinking superb now, give this beautiful wine a few years in the cellar to round out and you’ll be rewarded by mature and developed nuances for 12-18 years to come."

A monumental wine, that possesses huge notes of smoke, tobacco leaf, crushed flowers, blueberries, blackberries, and licorice in both the aromatic and flavor profiles. The finish is endless in this super-intense, rich wine. Like all of our Beckstoffer To Kalons the sweetness of tannins and the emerging complexity permits enjoyment at this early stage, but let it age for 10 to 25 years to see the best of what this wine has to offer.

The first taste is an opulent and rich attack on the senses, while the underlying minerality and significant structure result in a muscular but well-balanced Cabernet. A full-bodied mid-palate reveals the finely integrated tannins that lift the overall back bone of the wine into a finish abundant with black and blue fruits, and currants."
Carter Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon Beckstoffer To Kalon The O G 2014,"Oakville, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"As in the previous years, 2014 was a very good year for the ‘O.G.’ block of Beckstoffer To Kalon. This dense and ethereal Napa Cabernet Sauvignon reveals gorgeous notes of blackberry liqueur, complex floral undertones all matched with an inky deep purple color. Sweet tannins integrate with a plush, persistent and prodigious palate making this a complex wine which expertly showcases Napa Valley terroir. As with prior vintages of this wine, the structure and power of the clone 337 from the Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard lends itself well to an extended decant or several years of bottle age to really spread its wings. This wine should hit its prime in 7 to 10 years and continue to age and become more complex for decades"
Casanova di Neri Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2012,"Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy",Red Wine,98.0,"The 2012 Cerretalto is a wine with a strong charisma, in which the main traits of every Cerretalto joined together: richness, pleasantness together with freshness and elegance.

Chateau Cheval Blanc (1.5 Liter Futures Pre-Sale) 2019,"St. Emilion, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"In this vintage, the expressions of the 3 different terroirs of Cheval Blanc stand out perfectly.

This vintage combines freshness and complexity, power and precision, balance and density. Aromatic complexity dominates from the first nose and this wine expresses the elegance brought to it by optimal weather conditions. The significant proportion of Merlot brings particularly intense aromas of red and black fruit. The impressive nose is pure and precise with notes of raspberry, cherry, blackberry and blackcurrant embalmed in balsamic and subtle sweet aromas of pastries. The generosity and complexity of the nose dominate. Clean, pure and precise, this wine is lush and juicy reflecting perfectly the traits of the fresh fruit when it is tasted directly in the vineyard. A full, attractive attack is redolent of the Merlot of this vintage which is unctuous, round and mouth filling. The Cabernet Franc lends a lovely freshness to the mid-palate and gives the wine length on the finish. This wine is both dense and powerful whilst at the same time soft, unctuous and round.

They can be found in small quantites in Gigondas, at Chateau Rayas in Chateauneuf, in the Massif d'Uchaux, at Chateau de Montfaucon just on the other side of the Rhone river. They give to the grenache grape a very special expression, very refined and precise. The lieu-dit ""Hominis Fides"" was planted before 1902. It doesn't change much: it is a respectable age anyway. This vine has the ability to compensate the excesses of the vintages: it beautifully regulates itself. In a hot year, it will balance the alcohol with a very good physiological ripening. In a cool year, it will ripe quicker than the other vines. "

It possesses an enveloping body, the tannins seeming almost creamy. The wine expands taking a greater dimension on the palate while seeming never ending.

It has an intense, complex bouquet, blending hints of oak with blackcurrant, licorice, and chocolate. The nose reveals a seemingly endless range of aromas. On the palate, the breadth and expressivity of this wine is immediately impressive. The tannins are flavorful and its structure is poised, buoyed up by incredible freshness. To take an architectural metaphor, 2010 Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion is reminiscent of the Eiffel Tower. Its structure is immediately perceptible but, although it is obviously a substantial construction, it gives an impression of lightness and elegance. These contrasts make it easier to understand the challenge that faced the architects in both cases: to achieve perfect balance. "

Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2003,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"""A modern day version of the 1959 Lafite, the 2003 Lafite Rothschild was bottled in mid-May, 2005 after achieving 12.9% natural alcohol – hardly an astonishing figure given the vintage's weather conditions. A combination of 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, and 2% Petit Verdot, it represents a ripe version of the essence of Lafite-Rothschild. Dense purple-colored, with classic notes of graphite intertwined with melted licorice, creme de cassis, smoke, and flowers, it reveals extraordinary richness, opulence, power, purity, intensity, and viscosity. Whether this wine will close down or not is questionable as it is somewhat atypical given its sweetness and softness. Analytically, there are extremely high tannins, which I suspect will assert themselves in the future. Production in 2003 was less than half of normal. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2050."""

Chateau Malescot St. Exupery (Futures Pre-Sale) 2019,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"A delicate Malescot which makes it a gourmet wine despite a tight tannic structure. We will have to wait for this vintage to fully express the freshness of its cabernets supportedby a body full of merlots. As for the Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, they are like salt and pepper which densify and reveal this wine."
Chateau Margaux (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2015,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,99.0,"2015 was, literally, an historic year at Château Margaux. We celebrated the bicentenary of the Estate’s buildings dating from 1815, and the inauguration of the new facilities, designed or reorganised, by Norman Foster. It is easy to imagine how much we dreamed that 2015 would be a great vintage! Without doubt, some of the result is owed to decisions made at the time of blending; only 35% of the harvest went into the first wine, which was a record of severity for a vintage of this standard. As usual, it was the Cabernet Sauvignon in first place with 87% of the blend; in addition to its concentration and finesse, this year it has an unusual vigour and strength. The Merlot has nothing to be ashamed of, at least in the great plots; it makes up 8% of the first wine. Cabernet Franc (3%) and Petit Verdot (2%) also find their place in this elitist blend, which confirms that, enable all grape varieties to express their own propensity. How can we compare 2015 to its predecessors? It is a thankless task, and a little futile, particularly for the great vintages. There are, of course, similarities, affinities, and also some differences where we do not expect to find them… But we can evoke a combination of the strength of 2005, the flesh of 2009, the subtlety of 2010, and the inimitable charm of Château Margaux. (April 2016)"
Chateau Margaux 1983,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"A very classic Margaux with an unquestionably elegant, complex but still rather closed nose. The tannins are full-bodied and ripe on the palate, with no astringency or hardness."
Chateau Margaux 1989,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,97.0,"The evolution of the wine has confirmed the early expectations for this fabulous vintage. Richness, complexity and opulence could be the key words to describe this exceptional wine, rather close in style to the 1982; its evolution will be fascinating to follow."
Chateau Margaux 1990,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"Third extraordinary vintage in a row, this wine is a monument of charm, finesse, and elegance. All the organoleptic components on the nose, as well as in the mouth, already seem blended; yet this perfect and early harmony masks as much power as that of the 1989."
Chateau Margaux 2000,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,98.0,"We were unaware at that time that we were harvesting one of the greatest vintages of the late 20th century. The grapes had rarely, perhaps never, been as concentrated, particularly the Cabernets. In certain cases we surpassed the already historic levels of the 1986 and 1995 vintages, with an elegance and softness on the palate, reminiscent also of the 1990 and 1996 vintages. It seemed in fact that 2000 was setting a new benchmark in quality, never before attained, at least in terms of style. Throughout the barrel ageing time, these first impressions were gradually confirmed. The wine has now acquired a slightly tighter texture and at the same time keeps such a soft and especially long finish that it seems to go on forever… The bottling took place in November 2002, after over 2 years of barrel ageing. Such a long ageing is unusual but not as rare as one might think: most of the greatest vintages are aged for that length of time. (May 2010)"
Chateau Margaux 2009,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,97.0,"In 2009, mother nature surpassed herself. She allowed the greatest terroirs, whatever their grape variety, to bring their fruit to exceptional ripeness, providing a wine of wonderful concentration, finesse, balance and freshness. The Cabernet has no equivalent other than 2005, but it is more tender. The only two batches of Merlot that were kept have no equivalent at all. As for the Cabernet Franc and the Petit Verdot, they performed at their highest levels. "
Chateau Margaux 2010,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,98.0,"Unbelievable as it may sound, Château Margaux 2010 is at least as great a vintage as 2009. Once again, the Cabernet Sauvignon made the most of this very dry and cool year. With as much as 90% in the blend, the Cabernet makes the wine, providing it with exceptional aromatic finesse, restrained power and subtle freshness. Château Margaux 2010 is sheer magic – think classic, with a twist. Classic indeed, thanks to its purity, finesse and soft and refreshing finish. Add to these qualities astonishing aromatic complexity and outstanding power and the result is an exceptional year. Technology and stringent selection make it a “modern” wine, while its magnitude and charm ensure a timeless Château Margaux vintage. This 2010 is beyond the realms of time and fickle fashions. "

Chateau Margaux 6-Pack OWC (Futures Pre-Sale) 2018,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,99.0,"Chateau Margaux 2018 is remarkably concentrated. A small grape size and relatively low yields largely explain the exceptionally high tannin indices. The wine's power is not, however, overwhelming and helps to considerably lengthen the aromas and structure of the finish. Fairly early in the wine-making process, we understood this tannic potential and moderated our extraction programs including for our Merlot plots, which are usually less dense than our fine Cabernet Sauvignon wines.

Chateau Margaux (half-bottle) 1996,"Margaux, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,99.0,"An unusual end of summer - distinctly drier and cooler than average - has given birth to a wine whose classicism and purity already stand out. It is indeed very rare for the Cabernet Sauvignon to reach such perfection, such balance. Even rarer still is to see so young a Château Margaux with such astonishing richness, intense fruit and harmony of form. A dream."
Chateau Montelena Estate Cabernet Sauvignon 1987,"Calistoga, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98.0,"The very low yields from our estate Cabernet vineyard make this wine the essence of Chateau Montelena. The unique characteristics - the ""terroir"" ­of Montelena Cabernet are concentrated and extraor­dinarily preeminent in this wine. Beginning with the deeply-tinted color, the nose follows with waves of constantly changing aroma: dried fruits, roses and vio­lets, the rocky vineyard soil, cassis and leather, and the oak and cellar aromas particular to Montelena Cabernet.

Vineyard management was complex, therefore, but the direction of our environmental approach was firmly maintained. The fine weather and heat at the end of summer, comparable to 2009, made the vintage, which expressed incredible potential in the cellar.

It has a splendid structure, alsong with a long and round finish. The tannins are neat and defined."
Chateau Montrose 1989,"St. Estephe, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"This year proved to be particularly hot, sunny and dry, an ideal condition for bud burst, blossoming, ""veraison"", ripening, and great vintage. This exceptional year gave a splendid wine. "
Chateau Montrose 2009,"St. Estephe, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"Deep and dense, dark color with dark ruby tints. The nose is complex with morello, core of cherry and blackberry. It delivers notes of citron and spices (saffron). Aromas of redcurrant, cassis, morello, cocoa and liquorice develop on the palate. Supple and long-lasting finish on neat, coated and very precise tannins. Complex, balanced and harmonious wine. The tasting reveals very homogeneous, soft and silky. Incredibly long finish. "

Chateau Mouton Rothschild (1.5 Liter Futures Pre-Sale) 2019,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,99.0,"The wine is an intense garnet red with purplish hue. Fresh, highly expressive and precise on the nose, it reveals blackberry, black cherry and licorice aromas with a slightly mineral cast. It is smooth and opulent on the palate, with an attractive sweetness, enfolding superbly patrician, rounded and powerful tannins.

Chateau Mouton Rothschild (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2015,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,The grapes for this vintage were magnificent and fermentation took place quickly.

Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1996,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"""This estate's staff believes that the 1996 Mouton-Rothschild is very complex. I agree that among the first-growths, this wine is showing surprising forwardness and complexity in its aromatics. It possesses an exuberant, flamboyant bouquet of roasted coffee, cassis, smoky oak, and soy sauce. The impressive 1996 Mouton-Rothschild offers impressive aromas of black currants, framboise, coffee, and new saddle leather. This full-bodied, ripe, rich, concentrated, superbly balanced wine is paradoxical in the sense that the aromatics suggest a far more evolved wine than the flavors reveal. Anticipated maturity: 2007-2030. By the way, the 1996 blend consists of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, and 8% Cabernet Franc."""
Chateau Mouton Rothschild 2009,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,96.0,"The wine has a very deep, almost black color. The stylish and complex nose displays aromas of bilberry, blackcurrant and blond tobacco that mingle with subtle cedarwood and spice notes. The same refinement and density are to be found on the palate with patrician, well-rounded tannins, revealing remarkable structure and balance right through to the long and opulent finish. A great success for a Mouton Rothschild that will undoubtedly get the utmost out of the exceptional qualities for which the 2009 vintage has already been hailed."
Chateau Mouton Rothschild 2010,"Pauillac, Bordeaux, France",Red Wine,98.0,"The wine is a dark and intense red with a blueish tint. With Cabernet Sauvignon predominant, it displays a complex range of aromas. From lightly toasted vanilla notes, the nose opens with airing to reveal fruit aromas, especially blackcurrant and black cherry. Powerful and well-integrated tannins reveal exceptional depth and roundness on the palate, ending on a fresh and mineral finish. Length, elegance, harmony: Mouton Rothschild 2010 promises to be a remarkable vintage – and a worthy successor to the 2009! "

It is one of the best-known St. Emilions, vinified in a slightly lighter, more elegant style. With moderate red currant fruit in the nose, plus earth and spice, it can be peppery, spicy, or even leafy with hints of red cherries. Like other wineries in the côtes of St. Emilion, Chateau Pavie makes firm wines that are restrained and austere when young. The occasionally severe tannins mature with age into a fine sinewy structure. The better vintages are deep, intense, and concentrated. They mature 7-20 years after the vintage."

There is a well-developed and complex aromatic palette of chocolate, cacao, and black currant that is typical in wines touched by the sun, joined by an attractive spiciness. Supporting all this is a balanced woody character which is elegant and striking. The wine is somewhat paradoxical: it has an aromatic style reminiscent of those from the south of France; but the palate is surprisingly different, with still-developing, tight tannins, and the particularly dense and elegant body characteristic of a mature Bordeaux harvest. The long finish shows very good balance. This is a wine for long keeping which will develop fully only after five to 12 more years.

Chris Ringland Shiraz 1998,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,99.0,"We only get one bottle each year of the 1200 made.  Enjoy!A compelling effort from Chris Ringland (the name Three Rivers was dropped because of trademark litigation), this is his classic 1,200 bottle Shiraz cuvee from a 90-year old Barossa vineyard that yielded only one ton of fruit per acre. Aged in 300 liter French hogsheads (100% new) for 42 months prior to bottling, this is a prodigious offering from an exceptional vintage for South Australia. An inky purple color is followed by a gorgeous nose of minerals, blackberry liqueur, barbecue spices, sweet licorice, and a hint of white flowers. Remarkably concentrated, full-bodied, and unctuously-textured, its purity, definition, and compelling palate persistence as well as complexity are awesome. This is a magical wine from a winemaker who is a master craftsman. Anticipated maturity: 2008-2020+."

Enjoy!The name Three Rivers was dropped because of trademark litigation.The Three Rivers Shiraz, which is aged 42 months in 100% new French oak, and is rarely racked until bottling, represents an extraordinary expression of Barossa Shiraz. The intense 1999, released in 2004, demonstrates that this vintage is somewhat underrated after all the hype over 1998. From a vineyard planted in 1910, its inky/purple color is accompanied by aromas of lavender, lard, smoke, licorice, blackberries, cassis, espresso roast, chocolate, and pepper. Full-bodied, slightly less voluminous than the perfect 1998, with an unctuous texture, sweet tannin, and a 70+ second finish, this magnificent, still young Shiraz should be accessible in 3-5 years, and last for two decades."

There is an overriding sensation of earthy, mushroom like characters and more lifted aromas with licorice bark, coffee and vanilla. There are some hints of other spices as well with some nutmeg, cloves and fennel. All of this and more follows on the palate."
Clarendon Hills Astralis Syrah 2006,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,98.0,"Blackened purple/crimson. Low altitude of aroma. Soft and elegant exhibition of black raspberry and grilled meat, blue berry muffin, dark milk chocolate, liquorice, coffee, choc cake, incense, cinnamon, freshly baked Christmas cake, iodine, graphite and crushed rock. Relatively closed nose in contrast to mouth filling flavours, although continually evolving in the glass. Overall, a vividly intense concentration of characters although it remains trapped in the tannin. An atypical Astralis that is slightly more savory profiled than recent '03 and '05. Cascades of flavor roll along the most refined and sublime expression of Syrah in the cellar. Varietal characters driven by ripe, precisely focused tannin structure that fills your mouth with thousands of finely grained particles- from the moment after consuming: the flavors glide from one to another and the texture remains."

Most of these Syrah cuvees tip the scales between 13.5% and 14.5% alcohol, so they are not over the top by any means. Low yields, impeccable winemaking, and natural bottling have extracted the full essence of each vineyard. This blockbuster, compelling example of Syrah should last for two decades.  "

An extraordinarily velvety texture pulses with notes of rainier cherry, espresso roast, molasses, paprika, and hoisin. The remarkable finish is layered with unsmoked cigar, new cast iron, and melted black licorice aromas. This is a triumph of the vintage and should age gracefully for 20+ years or more."

Intertwined with the floral notes are heady layers of plum, blackberry, and red currents. Silky, unctuous flavors of smoked cardamom, cinnamon, and black licorice lay out on the palate and finish with the taste and texture of liquefied rocks."
Cliff Lede Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon 2002,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Driven by Cabernet, the blend includes three more of the five red Bordeaux grapes. Each of the blending grapes contributes to the final wine; Merlot adds richness and weight, Cabernet Franc contributes aromatics, and the Malbec intensifies color and spiciness. This is an aromatic wine. When decanting (which we suggest for our young red wines) the whole room fills with aromas of Bing cherry, clove and grilled brioche.   A full and rich wine on the palate, flavors of huckleberry, cassis and vanilla carry through to a persistent finish."
Cliff Lede Stardust Heaven Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,"Stags Leap District, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,98.0,"Stardust Heaven shows what great Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon has to offer. Dark and inviting, with enticing, explosive aromas of warm slate, black currants, and cassis, along with black licorice, and pain grille, this Cabernet is a sensual experience from start to finish. Silky and plush tannins combine with crushed rock and mineral notes, classic of the Stags Leap District, to make this wine irresistible now, but patience will be rewarded with cellar aging over the next twenty years."
Clos d'Agon Emporda Tinto 2009,Spain,Red Wine,97.0,"The Celler Clos d'Agon was purchased by a group of friends from Switzerland in 1998, making a dream become reality for the new owners, all of whom are attached to the wine business either through distributing, retail sales or winery ownership. The winery itself is only 11 years old.

It gets its velvety texture and supple core from the sandy soils of the estate's two vineyards, ""Guigasse"" and ""Bédines,"" located just behind the estate's ""clos."" Its midnight-purple robe reminds us why this color historically was reserved for royalty.

Stylistically, it probably comes closest to resembling the legendary 1990. Notes of roasted meats and smoked duck, with Provencal herbs, truffle, incense, licorice, and pepper, are all there, plus enormous quantities of red and black fruits. This is one heck of a complex wine, with a bouquet that is the essence of southern France, in particular Provence. Full-bodied, powerful, with the glycerin and level of richness covering some lofty tannins, this wine is already accessible and nearly impossible to resist, but my instincts suggest it will be absolutely glorious in another 4-5 years and keep for 15-20.

Across the palate, the mouthfeel is pure richness framed by ripe, supple tannins with a fine acid structure. After nineteen months of barrel aging in 100% new French oak, the wine was racked just once before bottling without fining or filtration.

In 2007, the flavors of the terroir are more dominant than ever. This vintage just has more of everything it seems. Terroir driven flavors of crushed rock, wet graphite, bay leaf and barbecue rub saturate the wine. Aromas of grilled meats, fennel seed, and a lift of black licorice bring seduction to the nose. With a sip, the pliant, silky tannins melt over the palate. The 2007 is dense to the core in every way, but at the same time it is open, expressive and alluring. It will drink well near term with its supple, rich tannins, but patience will be greatly rewarded, as the structure and natural acidity beneath will allow the wine to age 30 years or more. "
Colgin IX Estate Red 2008,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The 2008 IX Estate Red Wine is all about the aromas of the terroir. The 2008 vintage across the board has resulted in wines that first and foremost reflect their sense of place. The nose of the IX Estate is pure crushed rocks, clay and minerals at first, and with air the savory aromas of musk and bay leaf come through. Decadent notes of black licorice, black cherry and cassis bring succulence to the nose. The wine is silky soft up front on the palate, but then develops into deliciously layered tannins. "

The number IX refers to the parcel number and is also significant as the date Ann and Joe were married: 9/9. The 2002 vintage was the first, of four vintages, from this property to achieve the highest accolade of “a perfect wine”.

The wine possesses the Colgin hallmark of saturated black color and fresh uplifting aromatics of tobacco leaf, white and black pepper. This Syrah expresses its characteristics in a multidimensional manner with primary fruit aromatics moving to terroir driven earth, rock and organic aromas. The overall tannin structure and mouth feel are plush and suave. As with all of the wines produced by Colgin Cellars, our most important goal is to accentuate the elusive terroir.

Colgin Tychson Hill Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2005,"St. Helena, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"My first impression of this wine at the time of release is how surprisingly demure it is at first. I know how much power is at the core of the wine, and so I find it fantastically seductive the way it pulls you in to explore its depths. At first it exhibits dark undertones of smoked cayenne, musk, and ripe plums, yet as it is exposed to air in the glass it slowly unfolds and expresses compelling organic aromas of peat, nutmeg, and savory grilled steak juices. The wine is incredibly soft and silky on the front of the palate, and gains an amazing amount of weight as it glides to the back. The texture is delicious and draws you back so easily with its elegant, lingering finish. Given the nature of the wines self expression at this time, I recommend 3 years of cellar age, and with that you will be handsomely rewarded. With the freshness of the acidity and the coating texture to the tannin, I anticipate a long lived bottle age of 20 or more year."

Comando G Tumba del Rey Moro 2012,Spain,Red Wine,97.0,Tumba del Rey Moro is an absurd vineyard. It has all the appearance of the aftermath of an ancient landslide with several small natural terraces irregularly planted with vines. Until a few years ago the site was nearly inaccessible and overgrown with scrub brush. Yet when Dani and Fernando heard rumor of this plot they spent several months trying to locate it and clear a path so they could farm it. Here you can find a similar granitic sandy soil to their other sites but with more pink than grey granite as well as more quartz. Like its siblings it is pale in color but tasting it makes you wonder if this is what Marcel Lapierre could have done at Chateau Rays had he the chance.

Corison Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Wow. This inky wine jumps out of the glass with ripe boysenberries and floral perfume. 2013 was a near-perfect vintage with ideal spring weather for flowering, which resulted in a bumper crop of deliciousness. With highs seldom climbing out of the 80F’s and chilly nighttime lows, an unseasonably cool summer gave the wine its firm structure. Lush ripe red fruit with balancing natural acidity complement the characteristic Kronos viscosity. The tannins are assertive but feel like velvet."

In spite of the wine’s considerable density, the intense flavors arrive with a freshness and balance that is remarkable. There is great complexity of flavor, and a firm structure, with notes of blackberry, cassis and graphite coming from the Cabernet Sauvignon, and the Cabernet Franc adding elements of crushed stones and anise.

They have dramatically transformed that estate into their Helms Vineyard, to which they have added the Lotus Vineyard from the St. Helena hillsides and the Hershey Vineyard on Howell Mountain.

The nose shows intense and complex cedary, fig, blackberry and blueberry like smells occasionally pepper/spice smells too. Vanilla mocha oak smells and attacking blackberry, cassis characters are also evident on the palate.

Every three months we racked the wine out of barrel to clarify the wine and aid in its development. Although we added just a bit of Petite Syrah from the vineyard when ""topping"" the barrels, we decided the wine was perfect as it was when we were having our blending trials. Therefore, no additional lots were blended in, resulting in a wine that was 100% from the Todd Brothers Ranch, and 99% Zinfandel. We feel this wine should easily improve with ten or more years of bottle age.  "

De Lisio Shiraz 2004,"McLaren Vale, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,96.0,"""The profound 2004 Shiraz was cropped at a measly .5 tons of fruit per acre, and aged almost entirely in new French oak. It is a killer wine in a killer line-up from De Lisio in 2004. Dense blue/purple to the rim, this highly extracted (but not overly extracted) effort reveals notes of crushed rocks, blueberries, blackberries, camphor, lead pencil shavings, and spicy oak. Boasting great purity, a full-bodied, opulent texture, huge richness, but no sense of pruniness or flabbiness given its precision and refreshing structure, this is a well-balanced, potentially complex McLaren Vale blockbuster.

The rich, exotic fruit flavors and the honeyed botrytis character of the wine are complemented by toasty oak overtones that are balanced by a long, clean finish. Despite the difficulties experienced in the vineyard, this blend holds great promise.

Dom Perignon Oenotheque 1996,"Champagne, France",Sparkling & Champagne,96.0,"The year was full of contrasts and the summer changeable, with the wetter periods never quite making up for the earlier hydric deficit. Eventually, in the month before grape picking (16 September), it was as much the spells of hot weather as the influence of north-easterly winds that led to the original maturity of the vintage."

The warm aromas of hay and brioche mingle with those of bergamot orange and russet stone fruit. The overall effect exudes smoky grey accents. On the palate, the vibrant opening strikes the first chord, a prelude to a complexity that is more tactile than plump, and only gives of itself gradually. The distinguished viscosity is understated and simply fits around the contours of the wine. The length is exquisitely bitter and abounds with sap, a mingling of liquorice and toasted malt."
Dom Perignon Rose 2002,"Champagne, France",Sparkling & Champagne,98.0,"The wine's bouquet is lilting and luminous, with a wide spectrum dominated by an orange glow.

It is in no hurry, is very calm, references good Burgundy with Pinot-esque style. There is a murmur of oak. The palate sequels very well from the nose; there is a sensuous glass of wine here.

Grapes picked when fully ripe and meticulously hand-sorted for extra concentration.  Very low yield: 15-20 hl/hectare.  These old vines were planted in a mix of varieties: the symphony of 13 varieties is thus in evidence, but with a majority of Grenache.  This wine spends a long time in vats, and is matured in the most traditional ways: no filtration, 18 months' ageing in oak casks, fined with fresh egg whites, bottled and left to rest in our cellars."

The 2016 iteration of Bloom’s Field is both more generous and more composed than its predecessors. The deeply colored wine aligns with a rich nose of red berries, rose hips, seaweed, and soil. The palate is immediate and concentrated without being showy. The influence of both Bloom’s Field’s iron-rich clay top soil and marine sedimentary sub soil result in a juxtaposition of density and effortlessness for which Domaine de la Cote is always striving.

Upon release the nose yields sour cherry, black tea, sous bois, and citrus rind, all dancing in the glass and on a highly intricate palate. The finish is uniquely long and contemplative, confirming the wine need not be revisited for another 6-8 years."

Domaine Pierre Usseglio et Fils Chateauneuf-du-Pape Reserve des Deux Freres 2005,"Chateauneuf-du-Pape, Rhone, France",Red Wine,97.0,"""The limited production 2005 Chateauneuf du Pape Reserve des Deux Freres (100% Grenache with considerable press wine is aged in 60% demi-muids and 40% in one- and two-year-old barrels) is certainly one of the Chateauneuf du Papes of the vintage. There are about 6,000 bottles (500 cases) of this wine, which exhibits an opaque blue/purple color and a beautiful nose of blueberry, blackberry, scorched earth, pepper, roasted meats, and smoke. It is full-bodied, viscous, with an inky richness and thickness, but terrific acidity and rather high tannins. I can't see this wine being ready to drink before another 6-7 years of bottle age, but it should keep for 20+ years. Brothers Jean-Pierre and Thierry Usseglio have once again produced some of the finest Chateauneuf du Papes of the vintage, particularly in 2005. This is no small accomplishment given the fact that their 2003 cuvees were among the very finest wines of that challenging and irregular year."""

This vineyard was the source of fruit for some of the finest Napa Valley wines. Estate-bottled in the spirit of the Bordeaux châteaux, Dominus Estate is dry-farmed to allow natural stress and good concentration of fruit. Grape clusters are crop-thinned to allow sun and air to pass in between, helping to achieve full maturation and soften the tannins. Only 20% to 40% new French oak barrels are used in order to limit the extraction of oak notes. To express the unique terroir, the classic Bordeaux grape varietals of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot are planted with different root stocks best suited for the varying soil composition of gravel, heavy clay and loam.

Dow's Vintage Port (375ML half-bottle) 2017,Portugal,Collectible,96.0,"The 2017 was a very different year to 2016 in terms of the viticultural conditions and it was interesting to watch the progression of the wine and scrutinize its quality as it developed over its first two winters. Whereas 2016 had a very mild winter and exceptionally hot summer, this was compensated by abundant winter and spring rainfall. Conversely, 2017 was warm and dry throughout, although summer temperatures were closer to average, which proved to be a very significant factor allowing for complete, balanced ripening."

It’s tangy, dynamic and ever-changing, the palate uncompromisingly dry, mineral and chiseled—refined and totally captivating. The wine turns dense and full in the center as it uncoils, revealing oiliness and great viscosity. A firmness to the back end is driven by high natural acidity, strong savory elements and lime zest freshness."

Broad across the palate, density and weight. Clove, lavender and forest floor. Balances succulence and structure. Youthful acidity and fresh minerals extend the finish. Slower to open.

Complex floral/herbal aromas: juniper, bay leaf, anise then wild berry sweetness, kirsch, sassafras and tobacco. Great power and dimension to the palate. Rich, but never soft - a lean dynamic power.

Dunn Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon (1.5L Magnum - chipped wax) 2007,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,97.0,"Muscular Cabernet that will need four or five years to peak. Concentrated fruit has brawny tannic structure. Cedar, vanilla and dark chocolate from toasty oak will integrate with bottle age.

Dunn Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon 1995,"Howell Mountain, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The 1995 is densely concentrated and shows a dark ruby core moving to a rim of magenta and garnet. It displays a high intensity of aromas, featuring dried blackberries and cherry, cassis and over ripe plums. Its secondary aromas show some development and include a bouquet of bacon, game meats, leather, violets, and cedar. The palate offers pleasure with a delicious attack of sweet blackcurrant and licorice spice. Oak characters are well integrated with some background flavors of vanilla, toffee, mocha, and cinnamon. Some tasters noted a green or vegetal aspect to the wine with descriptors including thyme and green tomato. Earth characteristics ranged from iron-rich and compost to graphite. Most considered this wine to be youthful, with its high concentration of tannins, full body and fairly high levels of acidity. It seemed a difficult wine to grade because of the level of competition, almost every taster offered a tasting window from 2012 onwards."

Dutschke The 22 Year Old Tawny (375ML half-bottle),Australia,,98.0,"""The 22 year old Tawny"" is a blend of some fantastic individual components. Over recent years I have put together a 1,500 litre (5 Hogshead) Solera, where I now am able to bottle off a small volume of some consistently good quality port for my mail order and US market. Verdelho, Grenache and Shiraz make up over 70% of the blend, with much of this being over 30 years old, and responsible for adding lusciousness and the great ""rancio"" characters. This blend has also a splash of Frontignac, Rutherglen Muscat and a component of 33 year old Palomino that I included to add more complexity and richness.Each of these individual fortified wines have been left to rest and mature untouched for many years. My job was to find them all and blend together to generate a wonderful combination of flavours."
Dutschke The Tokay (half-bottle),Australia,,98.0,"Having a real love for good Aussie fortifieds I have now put together ""The Tokay"". It's a blend of Barossa Valley Tokay with the lusciousness, and nuttiness you'd expect from the Rutherglen Tokay's.  The idea of a Tokay developed during vintage 2002 when cousin Jeff asked if I could make him a barrel of Tokay for him to stow away in his shed. There was one remaining row of old Tokay in the vineyard and it's days looked to be numbered. This Tokay had recently been used for a local winemaker's sparkling wine base and was no longer required. The plan was to make a barrel of fortified Tokay for the shed and after vintage knock the vines out with the bulldozer. I struck a deal with Jeff, agreeing that if the wine shaped up well that maybe we would get to keep the vines.   We produced 4 hogsheads and the wine was great, and as a result the vines are now here to stay. 2 barrels of Tokay are in Jeff's shed and I got to take the rest. "

Frederic Esmonin Ruchottes-Chambertin Grand Cru (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2016,"Gevrey-Chambertin, Cote de Nuits, Cote d'Or, Burgundy, France",Red Wine,96.0,"Ruchottes is a very small Grand Cru, divided into three lieu-dits: Ruchottes du Dessus, Clos des Ruchottes and Ruchottes du Bas, which sits directly above Mazy-Chambertin Haut. The top sections of the Ruchottes are quite steep, with very shallow, and very poor topsoil due to erosion, whereas the lower sections are not quite as infertile. The wines from Ruchottes tend to be characterized as being more structured than other grand crus, but in reality they are finely fruited and more detailed, causing them to appear to be more structured than wines with a heavier fruit profile. The 60 year old vines work their way through the fractured Premeaux and Oolite limestone which lies just beneath the surface. Some Pinot Beurrot in this parcel gives the wine an added measure ofgras, notes Frédéric Esmonin” (Tanzer 2/2016)."

Monfortino represents, of course, a selection of the best grapes in the greatest years. But it also made differently, first undergoing an uncontrolled fermentation at relatively high temperatures. On average, Monfortino also remains an additional three years longer in large oak casks (botti). Monfortino’s extra aging in cask, says Roberto, is a consequence of the extraordinary structure, power and concentration of the wine."

It was aged for 15 months in new French and American oak. Opaque purple, it offers a sensational bouquet of pain grille, scorched earth, meat, game, blueberry, and black currants. This is followed by a surprisingly elegant yet powerful, structured wine with gobs of spicy fruit, ripe tannins, and a plush texture. The long, 60-second finish is succulent and sweet. Give this classy wine 4-6 years in the cellar and enjoy it through 2030. Hats off to Ben Glaetzer for producing an extraordinary portfolio! The renowned winemaker, Ben Glaetzer, sources all of his fruit for this label from the Ebenezer district in the northern Barossa. Many knowledgeable experts cite this sub-region as the finest in the Valley."""
Glaetzer Godolphin Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon 2004,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,98.0,"The wine is a seamless fusion of two varieties, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. A vibrant plummy red in color. On the nose, there are lifted blackcurrant and briary fruit, expressive of Cabernet Sauvignon, with pure cinnamon and chocolate spice. The Cabernet components remained on skins for 2-3 months and developed a savory complexity which tightens the shiraz. The palate has leafy, herbaceous notes and rich dark fruit flavours. Well-rounded and velvety, the tannins are ripe and focussed."
Goldschmidt Vineyard Oakville Game Ranch Cabernet Sauvignon PLUS 2005,"Oakville, Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The prestigious Game Ranch Vineyard is situated in the famed Oakville appellation in the heart of the Napa Valley. Located on an old river bottom on the eastern bench of the Silverado Trail, the vineyard is made up of very rocky, well draining soils. In this stressful, low moisture environment, the vines struggle to put everything they can into the development of the fruit. With perfect control over the watering of this vineyard site we are able to coax the vines to produce grapes of great concentration and exceptional quality.  Made with 100% Cabernet Sauvignon."

The great aromatic complexity and beautiful finesse that distinguishes this wine mean it can be paired with the most elaborate dishes."

Greenock Creek Creek Block Shiraz 2002,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,96.0,"This is more immediately harmonious and polished than most recent Creeks. It seems to be more classically predictable Barossa Shiraz of the highest order than one of your typically dirty, swampy, sweaty bayou-bluesy brutes. Its smooth, glossy aroma lets little glints of the usual aniseed and chocolate components show with time, and theres that delightful lolly shop whoof of dusting sugar, but thats it for the first half hour. The palates slender, with the lithe, sinuous acidity of a pole-vaulter, but hidden in a delicious wrapping of the cleanest, most intense and promising Shiraz possible. "
Greenock Creek Creek Block Shiraz 2004,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,99.0,"This ones not as swampy and marshy as many Creek Blocks have been, and while many have displayed fennel aromas - the volatile fennel grows right along the creek - the distinguishing factorthat tells us this is Creek Block is its mild Dutch licorice tang, with that pinch of salt. Theres no Piltdown Man this year, but a pleasant touch of tea tin, and overt chocolate, like in 1999 and 2003,with a pleasing shot of after dinner mint as well. The palates massive and squishy, like dark chocolate custard in a trifle, and that black tea comes back with its tannin to balance the lingering,solicitous, salacious finish. Like the 1999, the wine seems more alluringly feminine than most Creek Blocks."

Greenock Creek Seven Acres Shiraz 1998,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,96.0,"After it was planted in 1990, the Seven Acre block very quickly made clear its intention to supply low crops of intense Barossa Shiraz with a rare floral note highlighting its dainty, but dense bouquet. The palate is beautifully viscous and long, deliciously adorning the sensories like a magnificent silky drape. The tannins are leafy and green, but do nothing to interrupt that astonishing lingering smoothness of the finish and aftertaste. The wine offers great promise for the patient cellarmaster."
Greenock Creek Seven Acres Shiraz 2001,"Barossa Valley, Barossa, South Australia, Australia",Red Wine,98.0,"The Shiraz Seven Acre appears more earth-driven, revealing notes of tar, creosote, creme de cassis, licorice, and a hint of truffles. While firmer and more tannic, savage, and animal-like than its sibling, it possesses extraordinary density, power, and richness. Thirteen year old vines cropped at 1.4 tons of fruit per acre produced less than 100 cases."

Harlan Estate (1.5 Liter Magnum) 2007,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"This extraordinary estate, run by Bill Harlan, has never had either a shortage of ambition or patience. Harlan originally had his wines made elsewhere, but never found the resulting product up to his standards until his home vineyard, high on the western hills of the Oakville Corridor, hit an acceptable level of quality, which turned out to be in 1990. In October, I did a vertical tasting of every Harlan Estate vintage made (which I will report on at a future date), and one thing that was clear is just how extraordinary these wines are, and how well they are aging. Even in California's lighter, more challenging years, Harlan turned out wines that anyone would be happy to own and consume. The newest offerings include two vintages of The Maiden essentially their second wine, and the flagship Harlan Estate fewer than 2,000 cases produced."

Depending on the age of the vineyard and quality of the tannins, macerations may vary from one to three weeks. Rubicon is fermented in wooden Taransaud open-top tanks which hold the natural warmth of the fermentation longer into the maceration.

Though it is the most powerful of the Jonata reds in 2010, it also already strikes me as the most cohesive and complete at this stage. Unforgettable purity of fruit throughout and a remarkable weight on the palate. This wine boasts the most velvety midpalate of any Sangre to date. It flows across the palate with incredible energy and unmatched power. Seamless! The tannins build slowly at the start and form a formidable tower that will certainly reward cellaring. 2010 Sangre strikes me as a blend between the best aspects of the 2008 and 2009 Sangre in its combination of impenetrable black fruit, formidable extract and surprising brightness. "
Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2012,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,97.0,"Gamier and darker than the Todos at this stage. Truly lives up to its name. The 2012 is an exotic sangre with ripe fruit, pronounced black pepper, tar and truffle. Perfumed and powerful and equally impressive on the palate. Floods the mouth with densely packed black fruit. So much kinetic energy. Seamless travel across the palate. Even with the remarkable aromatic profile and mind-boggling density, it is the finish that leaves the lasting impression.

Combination of the tension and massive proportions of its 2007 predecessor and the delicate cool climate notes of the ethereal 2010."
Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2011,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Even at this early stage, it immediately jumps out of the glass aromatically. It displays some similarity at this stage to its older sibling, the legendary 2008. This is the first Sangre to include significant amounts of passito-style dried and whole cluster fermented wines (20%) and also a dollop of Grenache (6%). The resulting notes of dried herbs on the nose and the blast of ripe red fruit on the palate are a welcome addition to the simultaneously chaotic and focused mélange that is Sangre. After all this exotic talk of stem inclusion, drying fruit and Grenache additions, it is remarkable to note that this is the most reserved and elegant of all of the Sangre blends to date. It is beyond perfumed on the nose, but remains tightly coiled on the palate. With time in glass it opens to showcase peeks of velvet and plush richness on the mid palate. The earthy side of Syrah also plays a large role. It is soft and supple with remarkably fine tannins. This is a special Sangre.  "
Jonata La Sangre de Jonata 2013,"Santa Ynez Valley, Santa Barbara, Central Coast, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Still tight and closed, which is a great sign for a young Sangre with such a long life ahead. Scents of black plum, black pepper and soy sauce. Savory notes combine with lifted black fruit. Shows its power on the attack with superbly sweet mulberry fruit.

Jorge Ordonez Number 4 Esencia (375ML half-bottle) 2004,Spain,Boutique,99.0,"Esencia is a unique wine that incorporates the raisined muscat grape.

Joseph Drouhin Chambertin-Clos de Beze Grand Cru 2015,"Gevrey-Chambertin, Cote de Nuits, Cote d'Or, Burgundy, France",Red Wine,98.0,"A beautiful, intense ruby-red color. Powerful but refined aromas. When the wine is young, the aromas are reminiscent of black cherry and dark chocolate. With age, they evolve towards notes of undergrowth, truffle and liquorice. After 15 years or so, the aromas of candied fruit remain but are mingled with nuances of leather and musk. Tannins provide a good structure, perfectly balanced by the velvety texture of the wine. The long aftertaste brings back the aromas of cherry and liquorice: a kaleidoscope of sensations."

Joseph Drouhin Montrachet Marquis de Laguiche 1998,"Burgundy, France",White Wine,96.0,"This world-famous estate belongs to one of the oldest and most aristocratic French families : the Marquis de Laguiche. Out of the 14 different owners, the Marquis de Laguiche family is proprietaire of the largest portion of Le Montrachet, entirely located in Puligny (according to many authorities, the better side). It has been in their hands since 1363. It is ironical that the hillside of Montrachet, producing Burgundys most prestigious white wine (and in some say the worlds most complex), should look so unprepossessing. The etymology of the place-name is actually instructive : the word rachet refers to a poor type of soil where only scrawny bushes can grow. It is therefore on this ""poor, hard, infertile"" soil, which geologists call Bathonian limestone, that the Chardonnay grape develops this unique ""terroir"" character. Montrachet is full bodied and luscious, yet elegant. It is only after a few years in bottle that it will develop its famous complexity and richness. Nose and aftertaste are reminiscent of exotic fruit, honey, liquorice, grilled almond and many other flavours which wine lovers over the years have attempted to analyse. But it is perhaps a musical word which can best describe this glorious wine: a symphony of sensations."

Lewis Cellars Cuvee L Cabernet Sauvignon 2015,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"Straight from James Fenimore Cooper’s novel, Last of the Mohicans, comes our 2015 Cuvee L – a noble savage from an outstanding vintage with great depth of character. 100% Cabernet Sauvignon with the strength of a grizzly and the soul of a chief this onyx and indigo wine is cloaked in tiers of blackberry with a quiver of clove and cedary oak spices. Broad paths of richly rendered fruit trail into hand-hewn tannins reflecting nature’s winding ways."
Lewis Cellars Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2010,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0, 
Lewis Cellars Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (scuffed labels) 2012,"Napa Valley, California",Red Wine,96.0,"The headline reads: ""2012 Reserve Cabernet - Return of the Big Block"". Running on high octane aromas and built on an iron block with deep reserves of black fruit this 100% Cabernet blend delivers 700 horsepower at the wheels. Coming off idle the nose slowly explodes with sappy dark and rustic berries, clove, cedar and sweet oak spices. Forged, ripe fruit pistons pump out the power for miles until finally finishing with an impressive band of ported and polished tannins. Motor must be warmed-up before driving!"
